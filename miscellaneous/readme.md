## miscellaneous

This folder contains auxiliary files used during manual validation, model analysis, and data checking steps. These resources are not part of the core ML pipeline but were essential for debugging and verifying the integrity of results.

### Contents:

- `Smart_Contract_Misclassified.txt`  
  List of smart contract addresses that were incorrectly classified by the model, useful for manual inspection and model auditing.

- `Query_Data_Validation`  
  SQL-like or JSON queries used to cross-validate account and transaction data associated with the contracts.

> These files supported internal consistency checks and case-by-case analysis of specific smart contracts.
