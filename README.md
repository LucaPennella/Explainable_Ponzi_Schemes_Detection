# X-SPIDE: An eXplainable Machine Learning Pipeline for Detecting Smart Ponzi Contracts in Ethereum

This repository contains the resources associated with the paper  
**"X-SPIDE:An eXplainable Machine Learning Pipeline for Detecting Smart Ponzi Contracts in Ethereum"**, which proposes a transparent and reproducible approach for identifying Ponzi schemes deployed as smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

The X-SPIDE pipeline combines high-performance classification with explainability tools such as SHAP values and Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs), enabling not only effective detection but also insight into decision-making.

## Repository Structure

â”œâ”€â”€ dataset/ â†’ Cleaned datasets, bytecodes, contract addresses, and feature files
â”œâ”€â”€ data/ â†’ Scripts and Jupyter notebooks for training, evaluation, and XAI
â”œâ”€â”€ miscellaneous/ â†’ Misclassified contract lists, manual annotations, utility queries
â”œâ”€â”€ old_scripts/ â†’ Legacy scripts from early project stages (kept for reference)

## Dataset Highlights

- `DS_deployed_bytecode.csv`: Features extracted from deployed bytecode and transactions  
- `DS_full_bytecode.csv`: Combined dataset using creation + deployed code  
- `bytecode_opcode_8k.csv`: Opcode frequencies (absolute/weighted)  
- `Contract Adresses.csv`: All contracts included in the analysis  
- `duplicate_bytecode.csv`: Duplicated bytecode instances removed from training  
- `address_without_byt.csv`: Contracts whose bytecode was not retrievable  

> Datasets are cleaned, deduplicated, and formatted for supervised ML with binary classification (Ponzi vs Non-Ponzi).

## Features

- **Code-based features**: Frequency of opcodes from EVM bytecode (absolute and normalized)  
- **Account-based features**: ETH flow statistics, transaction timing, and initiator profit  
- **Label**: Ponzi (`1`) vs Non-Ponzi (`0`) classification
