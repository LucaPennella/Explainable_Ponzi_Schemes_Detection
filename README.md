# Repository for Explainable Ponzi Schemes Detection on Ethereum

This project presents an automatic and explainable technique to detect Ponzi smart contracts on Ethereum, which can be used as a backbone for the development of new detection tools.
This repository encompasses the project's scripts and datasets. It is organized in the following manner:

* **dataset**: This folder contains two datasets used for the project, 'DS_deployed_bytecode' and 'DS_full_bytecode', the list of addresses used, the list of obtained bytecodes, and some datasets related to the conducted checks.
* **data**: This folder contains all the scripts and notebooks used to develop the project.
* **miscellaneous**: Within this folder, there are some files related to the project, the list of misclassified contracts, and some queries used for checks.
* **old_scripts**: Contains all old scripts used in the first phases of the project.
